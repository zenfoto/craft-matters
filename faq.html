  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What legal transcription services do you offer?</h3>
    <p>Our transcription expertise covers: trials, hearings, custody, deposition, dissolution, interviews/interrogations, bodycams, and jail calls.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do you provide other transcription services?</h3>
    <p>Certainly.  If you have an audio file that needs accurate transcribing, we're happy to work on it.  Keep in mind that the cleaner the audio, the better the transcript.  If a transcript is highly technical, supporting documentation can really be of help.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What types of audio can you transcribe?</h3>
    <p>We generally can transcribe most any audio file including FTR files (Oregon court-specific audio files), as well as other common formats: MP3, WAV, AAC, WMA,FLAC, OGG, AMR, AIFF.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do you transcribe video?</h3>
    <p>Yes.  We routinely transcribe video interviews, depositions, and bodycams in conjunction with legal matters, but any type of video can be transcribed.  We accept all standard video formats, including MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV, and MKV.  If you have another format, we can likely convert it for you for a small fee as part of the transcription service.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What is your typical turnaround time?</h3>
    <p>Project turnarounds depend on length and complexity. Formal Appellate transcripts (cases on appeal to the Oregon Court of Appeals) normally have a 30-day turnaround.  Private matters can typically be turned around within 30 days.  Requests for transcripts within 14 days or less are considered RUSH.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What is your pricing.</h3>
    <p>In Oregon, proceedings on appeal are billed at $4.25 per page. Rush transcripts (14 days or less) for proceedings on appeal are billed at $5.25 per page.  In addition, difficult audio including video transcripts are billed at $5.25 per page. All other matters fall into private pay categories and depend on complexity, duration, and turnaround time.  We estimate private pay transcripts competitively and fairly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How will the transcripts be delivered?</h3>
    <p>We normally provide final transcripts in PDF format, in part, because we use legal-specific transcript software. If you have an alternative requirement (Microsoft Word Doc or similar), we absolutely can consider that request.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Is confidentiality provided?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Client and content confidentiality is a necessary part of our process.  We are formally certified with the State of Oregon for confidentiality compliance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do you use AI to complete your transcripts?</h3>
    <p>No.  AI transcripts are (1) not accepted by the State of Oregon and (2) notoriously bad for accuracy particularly in a legal context.  That said, we do use AI tools to help with accuracy, verification of citations, technical terms, and the occassional grammar quandary. We think AI is a great tool, but it cannot (yet) replicate the reliability and accuracy and, most importantly, the complexity and nuance of human speech.  Context matters in accurately transcribing the challenging audio environment that is a courtroom proceeding, a deposition, an interview, video, or bodycam.</p>
