<h2>About Craft Matters</h2>
  <h3>The Humans</h3>
  <p>We're Douglas and Kelley Vincent, three-year residents of Jacksonville, Oregon. We moved to Jacksonville from Bend, Oregon, where we enjoyed all Bend had to offer for nearly 10 years. We both originally moved to Bend (separately) in 2013 from California. We "bumbled" into each other in 2017 and subsequently shared adventures road-tripping throughout much of the American West.  Then Covid hit, we adopted two lovely kittens, and in a six-month span in 2023, we got engaged, married, and moved to our little slice of Southern Oregon paradise.  We really enjoy all that the Rogue Valley has to offer.</p>
  <h3>The Business</h3>
  <p>We started Craft Matters, LLC in 2022 as a small family business that allowed us to work remotely and flexibly. Having experience in theater, media, marketing, and technology, the work (a bit surprisingly to us) appealed to our love of narrative, inquiry, and investigation. We learn something new every day.</p>
  <p>We value craft and excellence.  We provide professional transcription services with a focus on accuracy, reliability, and expertise in Oregon legal formatting and conventions. Our philosophy is simple: quality work, clear communication, and meticulous attention to detail.</p>
  <h3>Happy Places</h3>
  <p>When not transcribing, Kelley immerses herself in the local theater community and Douglas pursues his love of <a href="https://www.douglasvincent.com">photography</a>. We both love adventuring outdoors, struggling to grow things in our garden, and a great glass of locally produced wine.</p>
